Here’s the progression that I found best for me:

* Always start with the official Django tutorial -
  Writing your first Django app, part 1
Continue to plow through in-depth tutorials. These authors kindly hold your hand while you learn to walk. This is where the bulk of your time will go -
Django by Example – Book
Test-Driven Development with Python
Build some more advanced Django projects while still being closely held -
Lightweight Django
Web Development with Django Cookbook
Read about Django design patterns and best practices. The authors are letting go now; they won’t give you a lot of code or details. You should be confident walking on your own now! These authors will show you where to go -
Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.8
High Performance Django The Book
Examine some Django projects out in the wild. Fork them and play with them -
What is the best Django source code available on the Internet for learning purposes?
It’s time to spread your wings and fly - create your own Django applications! Test them; deploy them; show them to your friends. Congrats you’re a Django developer now!
Optional: Donate to the Django Software Foundation with all the $$$ you are now making and consider working on open source projects -
Support Django | Django
Open Source Projects - Django
Note: There are certainly books out there other than these, but I’ve found these to be supremely helpful!
