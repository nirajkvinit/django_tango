Here’s the progression that I found best for me:

* [Always start with the official Django tutorial](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-way-to-learn-Django/answer/Mark-Dawson-20?srid=Cowl) -
  Writing your first Django app, part 1
Continue to plow through in-depth tutorials. These authors kindly hold your hand while you learn to walk. This is where the bulk of your time will go -

* Django by Example – Book
* Test-Driven Development with Python

Build some more advanced Django projects while still being closely held -
 * Lightweight Django
 * Web Development with Django Cookbook

Read about Django design patterns and best practices. The authors are letting go now; they won’t give you a lot of code or details. You should be confident walking on your own now! These authors will show you where to go -
 * Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.8
 * High Performance Django The Book

Examine some Django projects out in the wild. Fork them and play with them - What is the best Django source code available on the Internet for learning purposes?
